## Cody Ray

Grug-brained dev largely focused on data—designing schemas, analyzing complex datasets, and building tools to support that work. I primarily work with Go, Python, Bash, and PostgreSQL—with a bit of Lisp when I can justify it. I like to keep things as simple as possible. Interested in too many things at once, and fine with that.

Finishing a B.S. in Computer Science at Oregon State University and working with a great team at My Price Health.
