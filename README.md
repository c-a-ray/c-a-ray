## Cody Ray

Currently finishing a B.S. in Computer Science at Oregon State University and working with a great team at My Price Health. My work has mostly focused on the backend, including building data pipelines, designing schemas, and developing tools to support that work. I've also spent time in other parts of the stack and enjoy digging into unfamiliar problems.
